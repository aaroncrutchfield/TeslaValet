### Description
Tesla Valet was created at the MSU SpartaHack IV in January 2018. The team consisted of [myself](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-crutchfield/), [Smriti Wadhwa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smriti-wadhwa/), and our mentor [Rod Mastria](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodmesquita/). Our app won the ["Best Hack For Tesla" award](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6361014852781170688).

Our goal was to create an app that would allow your Tesla to treat you like a Valet service. Whether you have your hands full of shopping bags or you just want special treatment, you never have to worry about manually opening the doors or trunks again.

We achieved this by creating a geofence at the location of the Tesla once you park and exit the vehicle. When you return, preset doors and trunks automatically open for you once you are within 10 feet of the vehicle.
